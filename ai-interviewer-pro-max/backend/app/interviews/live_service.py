Live Interview Service

Business logic for real-time interview session management.
Uses Groq API for fast, conversational interactions.

Per requirements:
- Groq is the PRIMARY engine for live interviews
- Low latency responses
- No deep analysis (that's for Gemini later)
- Personality modes affect tone, not scoring
